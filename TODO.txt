Summer 2015:
MRC: I tried updating to Ubuntu 15.04 and the latest OCaml toolchain.

* lxde (vanilla) is frequently crashing and restarting the window manager
* I have to [eval `opam config env`] otherwise utop crashes with an Out of memory exception


From before Summer 2015:
 - introduce new targets for the 3110-tools/cs3110-cli Makefile
     to build staff or student versions
     (avoid the need to comment/uncomment the target list in cli_main.ml)
 - Bash completion for cs3110 command
 - more fleshed-out installation instructions (cross platform)
 - test for the past psets
 - figure out how to not install texlive-fonts-extra
 - try to trim disk size / install time

 - figure out PS6 gui
 - figure out shared folder (/vagrant ? as of spring 2014, not working)
